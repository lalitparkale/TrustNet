Prototype is envisioned to be a working system, mainly to get the end to end system flow working with all essential plumbing done. Once the end to end flows are working, then aspiration is to seek live feedback from customer research and rapidly update the prototype to deploy and learn.

To rapidly build, release and iterate at scale, AI will be used as the faithful companion, assistant and a teacher. 

**AI in development**
- Use of Co-pilot for app and core engine development 

**AI for exceptional UX experience**
- edge AI to ensure user data does not leave the mobile device
  
**AI for trustworthy logic execution**
- Post Install - Read contacts, obfuscate, create hash pairs [unique user#, contact#] and send to AI warehouse
- On contacts received - identify service provider numbers from received contacts
- Mine service providers - Go out to the wide internet to mine service provider contacts
