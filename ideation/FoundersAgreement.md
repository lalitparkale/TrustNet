**Note:** Assumptions prior to the drafting of the agreement, together with rationale:

Majority required to make major decisions: 76%+ (objective: ensure the primary share holder is part of the decision making

Vesting: 4 years (due to the need to move fast in that industry, but the necessity to be patient)

Cliff: 1 year (substantial amount of work required during the first year, requiring collaboration from all co-founders) Initial split of shares: after research, equal split is strongly recommended (from a co-founder motivation/involvement point of view, and rationale that past contribution from a co-founder and the future one might differ substantially. Nevertheless from a leadership point of view and to ensure ease of decision making, one co-founder should obtain a slightly higher share, e.g. 28% for the primary shareholder, and 24% for the 3 other cofounders (for a total number of shareholders = 4.

Assessment of cofounders contribution: rather than time, financial, network, etc contributions to the project, identified deliverables should be discussed and allocated among team members. Consistent failure to meet expectations by one of the team members and acknowledged by co founders representing 76%+ of the shareholder rights should lead do discussion whether the participation to the project should be adjourned for that individual and what retribution is reasonable based on the contribution made to the date of the decision.

In case of the exit of a co-founder, the rights should be equally divided between the remaining co-founders.
