# TrustNet
Development of TrustNet app to utilise the powerful network of friends and friends to get things done when you need it.

Our approach is to design, build and operate apps and systems with automation as default principle. Human intervention will be in extreme exception scenarios. AI will assist us in every aspect of our work, like design, coding, backend, sales, operations, funding.


AI development will be guided by set of principles listed below, which are borrowed from Microsoft's Responsible AI principles.
1. **Fairness** - Treat all people fairly and without bias. We will do this by quantity the extent of data that influences the model's prediction.
2. **Reliability and safety** - system should perform reliabily and safely. We will do this by rigorously testing and managing deployment processes.
3. **Privacy and security** - Respect privacy. We will do this by treating privacy and security at the highest level for using data and making decisions based on that data.
4. **Inclusiveness** - Engage all people. We will do this by broadening our horizons to benefit our society and communities.
5. **Transparency** - Understand the data and the inner working. We will do this by making our systems and models understanble to users.
